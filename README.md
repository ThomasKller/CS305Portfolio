Artemis Financial was an consulting agency that dealt with clients investments, retirements, and general financial well being. They wanted a secure application for clients to see their investments, as leaked financial information could be very damaging. For this reason it is important to code securely, and if there is a large enough security leak a company could go out of business. Looking at the software vulnerabilities, I analyzed how severe the risks were in each vulnerability. There were many vulnerabilities that could be avoided or fixed, and thus it seemed there were many false-positives. The vulnerability assesment was helpful because I learned how easily vulnerabilities in code can arise, and the necessary steps to take to avoid or nullify them. Double checking the vulnerability report was important because new vulnerabilities can arise. The dependency check tool will certainly be useful in future coding work, as it is a vital part of coding securely.
